# CPSC471 (Databases) Final Project: Ryde

Ryde is a hypothetical system for a Ridesharing web app that allows users to rent bikes and scooters, and request Rydes from drivers. 

## Running the Project
1. Run `npm install` in the Backend and frontend folders
2. Run `npm start` in both folders
3. Check out localhost:3000 and you should see the frontend running!
